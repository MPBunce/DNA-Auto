From day one, we made sure it left with the proper maintenance components and continue to supply the genuine replacement parts it needs throughout its journey.\n\nThis stunning 570S was exported with one of our signature Export Maintenance Packages, which included:\n\n-  Oil 🛢️\n-  Brakes 🛑 \n-  Filters 💨\n-  Original factory McLaren monogram car cover straight from the UK 🇬🇧\n\nClient Location: Ghana 🇬🇭\n\nParts & Accessories By Us: @dnaautosource \n\nVehicle Sold and Shipped By Our Partners: @ohwow_cardealsexports \n\nIt’s been an honor to be part of the ownership experience of such a rare exotic—and we’re proud to keep it running like the day it left the showroom. If you’re exporting or maintaining an exotic vehicle, give us a shout — there’s no car we can’t handle 💪\n\n#McLaren #570S #Spider #DNA #Auto #Source #Explore #Carswithoutlimits #Carsofinstagram #SuperCarsOfGhana",
