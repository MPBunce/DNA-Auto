Rusted suspension, worn brakes, and a failed AWD coupler were just the start. The dealer’s solution? A repair quote higher than the SUV’s value.\n\nThey called us instead—and we sourced and fixed every issue for a fraction of the price ✅ Here’s what went into the full refresh:\n\n 🔧4 Wheel Shocks, Struts, Springs, Control Arms, Tie Rods, & Sway Bar Links\n\n 🔧 4 Wheel Pads, Rotors, & Calipers\n\n 🔧 AWD Coupler & Rear Differential Fluid\n\n 🔧 Hood Struts\n\nCustomer Location: Canada 🇨🇦\n\nCanadian cars endure some of the world’s toughest road conditions. When yours needs a complete refresh, trust DNA Auto Source to keep your family moving—without breaking the bank.\n\n#Infiniti #QX60 #Nissan #OEM #DNA #Auto #Source #Explore",
